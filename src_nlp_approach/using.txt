word similarities 
embeddings
https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers
with just annotations and once with just text (separated in goal and benefit parts)

--> Once with predefined embeddings and once with finetuned embeddings
--> Also possible to find closly ranked redundancy sentences 
--> Clustering of similar redundancies
--> Using Vector Database to find similar goal and benefit parts which represents also a graph
--> Representing US as graph structure and find redundancies by common distances and shared nodes
