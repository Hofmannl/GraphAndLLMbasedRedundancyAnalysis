            This function performs the following steps:
            1. Copies the global variable `json_input_examples` and filters each entry to retain only keys specified in `schema_keys`.
            2. Initializes a string with introductory content from the global variable `INTRO_OF_EXAMPLES`.
            3. Iterates through each entry in the global variable `json_output_examples`, retrieves the related user stories by `USID`,
            and constructs a formatted example text showing the input examples and their expected output.
            4. Constructs a dictionary with a user role and the formatted content.
